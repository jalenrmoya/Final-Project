# The Hating Sim
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2023

## The Reverse Theme
This game "reverses" the typical concept of a Dating Sim by making the objective not to win over the love of a girl, but instead to make her break up with you.

## Game Play
The player's objective is to choose dialogue options that influence their path to either get the good ending,  neutral ending, or bad ending. The player should strive to get the good ending.

To play, the player only needs to use the left mouse button to select buttons and dialogue options.

## Impediments
Things honestly went shockingly smoothly. I can't think of any notable setbacks we had. Of course we would have liked to have been able to implement more sound effects, colored sprites, a longer story, etc. but we budgeted our time well with the 48 hours we had, I think.

## Implementation
The game uses the Godot add-on Dialogic: https://dialogic.coppolaemilio.com/

The game features a mechanic where the ending of the story will change based on the hidden "Love Score" of each dialogue choice the player makes.
